## A little introduction

Discord has evolved into a platform for many kinds of bots to be created out of it, and there has been.

However, having a lot of bots in your server for each kind of bot is tedious, as you have to get used to its set of commands, its prefix, and it's confusing for your members.

That's why we created Melonian.
*The bot is work-in-progress.*
